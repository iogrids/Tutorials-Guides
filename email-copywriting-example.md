I'm offering every course and mastermind I've done + 1 on 1 coaching until you're successful. Read on to learn all about it...

Why am I doing this?

Every course I do is sold to a limited number of people. I do this because I want the information to stay exclusive. I’ve had people beg to buy

recordings of my past courses, but I’ve always turned them down. 

I recently did an audit of all my courses, and realized there is a MASSIVE amount of actionable content. 

These courses include nearly every live event and online course I’ve done in the last 10 years. These are in person live master mind workshops I held
in Las Vegas, New York, and San Francisco. It also includes nearly every single online masterclass I’ve done. 

I want this content to help people make money. A lot of money. So, I came up with a great idea. 

I want to personally help each student become incredibly successful. In fact, I’m going to personally mentor you until you’re successful. Keep reading for more info…you’re going to like this. 

Who will you learn from?

You won’t just learn from me. You’ll also get to learn from some incredibly successful and talented people.

Here’s a sample of just a few people you’ll learn from: 

- An affiliate who started from nothing and went on to have $x,xxx days and then $xx,xxx days. He’ll break down exactly how he did it, including some interesting case studies. 

- A member of Aff Playbook who joined the forum as a newbie and went on to earn in the high $x,xxx per day. He’ll show you what mistakes he made in the beginning, and what he did to break through. You’ll also learn how he makes big money with traffic sources you’ve never even heard of. 

- The creator of a popular tracking program shows a unique and profitable case study using online and offline promotion and how he got the idea.

- Someone who helped an affiliate go from earning $0 to earning over $1 million per year. Find out what it takes to get to that level, and why many affiliates don’t get there. What this guy does isn’t ‘easy’, but it’s not complicated and anyone could do it if they were willing to work hard enough. 

I learned a ton myself from the people in these workshops! 

What Does the Content Include? 

There are 22 courses in total with nearly 200 hours of top notch video and audio content. 

Plus - landing page templates, keyword lists, and plenty more!

That’s a lot! If you’ve taken a course from me, you know I don’t pad them with ‘filler’ material, so that’s 200 hours of solid information. 

It’s difficult to summarize and describe 10 years + 200 hours worth of information for you here. I’ve done my best to give you give you some examples of what you’ll learn, but please ask if you have any questions. 

Just keep in mind for each short bullet point, there’s a massive amount of information. 

These aren’t just ‘lessons’. There are many detailed case studies showing the inner workings of successful campaigns and ideas. We don’t hold back anything in these sessions. 

These courses and masterminds cover a wide variety of traffic types, traffic sources, niches, and ways to make money including: PPC, PPV, media buys, mobile, Facebook, Organic, and even some offline methods. 

Here are just a few highlights:

- A $1k/day case study promoting dating on PPV
- An affiliate shows how he went from struggling to $x,xxx per day, and then $xx,xxx per day
- A case study showing how to quickly test every single offer on an affiliate network 
- How one affiliate dominated the Latin American market in several niches
- Behind the scenes of a CPA advertiser. How advertisers work on the backend. How affiliates can get screwed, and how they can succeed. This is stuff 99% of affiliates don’t know or have never heard. 
- Various case studies and tips for running high volume campaigns on different traffic sources
- A deep dive lesson into the dating niche on PPV showing exactly how to run it profitably

- Case studies showing different weight loss campaigns angles that work

- My personal traffic generation blueprint for organic/free traffic
- How to build surveys and funnels to monetize any type of traffic you can find. This is an awesome method. 

And SO much more! Really, I feel like that just scratches the surface. 

You’ll also have access to:

A private training I did for a large, well known CPA network. This was a workshop where I trained an affiliate network on how to make their affiliates more successful. There’s some great examples of offer research, profitable campaigns, traffic sources, and insider tips from myself and the network owners. 

Freelancing & Consulting Bundle

You’ll get access to 3 different courses teaching you the ins and outs of freelancing and consulting. These workshops will teach you everything you need to know to run a successful business. There is a lot of content here from beginner to advanced. You’ll also get a large number of downloadable documents and supplementary material. 

eCommerce

Learn how to get up and running quickly with eCommerce. This course gives you a complete plan to follow. You’ll learn how to choose products, set up your store, drive traffic, and increase sales through paid and organic traffic. The course focuses on dropshipping which is a great place to start with eCommerce because you don’t need a large budget for inventory. 

****Bonus****

There is one bonus, but it’s a BIG one. 

At the top, I said 'I want to personally help make each student incredibly successful.' What does that mean?

Well…I’m going to personally coach you 1 on 1 until you’re successful. Yes, you read that correctly. 

When you buy this bundle, you’ll get a monthly private coaching call with me for an entire year. This won’t just be a quick check in hour long call either. We’ll stay on the call as long as we need to, in order for you to become more successful each and every month. If we need to say on the call for hours, that’s what we’ll do. 

A year of private coaching is an awesome bonus by itself, but there’s more…

If you’re not successful at the end of that first year, I’m going to KEEP coaching you until you ARE successful. 

In other words - You have my personal guarantee that I will keep working with you until you’re successful. 

The definition of ‘successful’ will be different for everyone of course. Someone might consider making $60k per year to replace their day job income successful, and someone else might need to make well into the six figure range before they consider themselves successful. 

We’ll decide what ‘successful’ means to you personally on our calls. Don’t worry, I’m not going to say ‘hey you’re making $10/day, now you’re successful..bye.’ 

On the other hand, if you’re making $2k/day but won’t consider yourself successful until you’re making $100k/day we might need to talk 

The bottom line is this - I will work with you until you’re successful. Even after that, I won’t totally cut you off. We can still check in and keep you on track. 

Note - this is optional of course. You don’t HAVE to do the coaching if you purchase this bundle. If you just want to go through the courses by yourself that’s totally fine. I would definitely encourage you to take advantage of the coaching though 

Questions and Answers

Is there a discount if you’ve taken classes or workshops in the past?

I have a lot of loyal students. Some of you have taken nearly every course I’ve taught, which is awesome! If you’ve taken any course or attended a workshop in the past, please contact me regarding a discount. 

If some of the content goes back years, is it still relevant and actionable?

This is an important question that will help you understand and get the most out of this content. 

A good majority of the content is from recent courses, but even the older ideas are things I still use in my marketing, so I can tell you without a doubt they work today. 

One of the core ideas of my teaching is focusing on strategies that are unlikely to just stop working. I go into great detail about the idea behind the case study/idea. That way, you can easily adapt it. 

There are some things in the older courses that are either outdated, or are no longer an option so…I’ve gone through each and every single minute (yes, it took for-ev-er!) of these courses and updated things. 

I’ve included any information you need to know to make each technique work today. I’ve also added everything I learned about these techniques since then. These are all strategies I’ve used for a long time so I’ve learned how to make them even better. 

What format are the courses in?

The content is mostly video and audio. Each course is different, but you’ll also receive a huge number of extras like slides, landing page templates, keyword/target lists, and lots of other goodies. 

Do you really think you can help me become successful?

Yes, I do. However, remember I’m just one part of this. You need to be willing to do the work and stick with it. I’m not going to ask you to grind out 12 hours days or anything, but you must be willing to put in consistent effort to reach your goals. 

I’ve coached thousands of students, and I’m pretty darn good at it  If you’re willing to follow my advice and put in consistent effort I’m confident you will be successful. I can’t guarantee when it will happen of course, but we’ll stick with it until it does. 

Do you offer a money back guarantee or refund policy?

I normally do offer a money back guarantee for my courses just to give people peace of mind. With this bundle, there are no refunds and I will explain why. 

This offering includes all of my very best, and extremely exclusive content. A lot of this has only been taught in person to a small handful of people. It’s not fair to other students if someone gets to look over a decades worth of content, download it, then ask for a refund. It would be one thing if this were a single course, but this is the entire vault. 

I’m also dedicating a LOT of personal time to each student. I don’t expect anyone to ask for a refund, but I wanted to put this up just in case. 

There is so much here, you won’t be disappointed. Remember, I’m going to work with you until you’re successful, so there isn’t much risk. 

Can I pay in two payments?

Yes, however the content will not be delivered until the second payment is made. Please contact me for details. 

Cost and Details

The cost of the course and workshop bundle is $3997. That price includes:

All 22 courses
Nearly 200 hours of video & audio content
Landing page templates
Keyword and target lists 
Presentation slides
Numerous other downloads

And of course, the 12 months (or longer) of 1 on 1 coaching until we get you successful. 

Because of what I’m offering, and the time involved with private coaching, I’m selling an extremely limited number of spots. It’s strictly first come, first serve. 

I only have time for a small number of students, and I want to give them my full attention. Once this deal is gone, there will be no way to purchase it in the future. 

I also want to give you some perspective on the price. It may be a stretch for some, but if you think about what you’re getting, it’s an amazing deal. You’re getting my entire vault of content, plus my commitment to work with you until you’re successful. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change your business and your life. I’m confident I can help you become successful. Chances are extremely good that once we start working together, you’ll easily be able to pay for the cost of this program. 

Ready to Take Action?

I’m only selling a few spots so I don’t want to use a public payment link.
