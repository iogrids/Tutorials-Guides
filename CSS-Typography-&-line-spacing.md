## Typography - Fonts and Line Spacing

### Rules:

1. Use a font size of 15px - 25px for body text

2. For headlines you can use a font size of 60px

Note: When you increase the font size always decrease the font weight of the text. This ensures that the text doesn't steal too much attention from the rest of the content and it makes the text look less bulky.

3. For sub-headlines you can use a font size of 32px

4. Use a line spacing of 120% and 150% of the font size. So if the font size is 15px use a line spacing of 15*120% = 18px

5. One rule of typography for subheadline is if you have two lines the first line should not be very wide and the second have a smaller width than the first line. Both the first line and second line should be of the equal width. To achieve this you can use the 

```
   width: 
   margin-left & margin-right:
   
```


### Fonts

1. You can either use sans-serif fonts or serif fonts
